Dear user, 

Instead of downloading all the files in the list, we recommend that you 
download the WinZipped (v. 8.1) file ConservationLawsMD.zip, which contains

ConservationLawsMD.nb: a notebook to run the program (with instructions and 
                       a sample output for the Korteweg-de Vries equation).

ConservationLawsMD.m : the source code in Mathematica syntax. (Be aware, 
                       this file is quite long and some older editors may
                       not load it completely),

d_kdv.m : the data file to run the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation,

and ALL other data files listed in the menu of the program. 


Instructions for using the ConservationLawsMD.m program are given in the 
notebook. You need Mathematica v. 5.0 or higher to be able to use the program.

Best wishes, 

Dr. Douglas Poole and Prof. Willy Hereman
